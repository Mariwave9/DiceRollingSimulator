    "dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever\n",
    "other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.) The program will print\n",
    "what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. For this project, you’ll need\n",
    "to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a\n",
    "minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number\n",
